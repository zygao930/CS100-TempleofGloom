In addition to the standard grading criteria this assignment will be graded according to its:

+  ability to fulfill the requirements; 
+ the simplicity, clarity, and the generality of the code (including succinct but illustrative comments and `JavaDoc`); and 
+ compliance with good practices of coding and version control as outlined during the module (e.g., committing often and in small pieces, use
of descriptive commit messages, committing only source code and **not binary or `.class` files**).

The vast majority of points on this assignment will come from a correct solution that always finds the Orb and escapes before the time runs out, so your priority should be to ensure that your code always does this successfully. To receive full credit for the assignment, your solution must also get a reasonably high score (achieved by optimizing the bonus multiplier in the explore phase and collecting as many coins as possible in the escape phase), so you should spend some time thinking about ways to optimize your solution. While the time your code takes to decide its next move does not factor into the number of steps taken or the time remaining and consequently does not affect your score, we cannot wait for your code forever and so must impose a timeout when grading your code. When running in headless mode, your code should take no longer than roughly ten seconds to complete any single map.

Solutions that take significantly longer may be treated as if they did not complete and will likely receive low grades.

**Using Java Reflection mechanisms is strictly forbidden and will result in significant penalties.**
