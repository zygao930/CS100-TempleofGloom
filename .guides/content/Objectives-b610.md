The aims of this coursework assignment are to:

- learn how to understand and extend an existing code base,
- focus on the essential (and relevant) packages within that code base,
- work with packages,
- become accustomed to the features of modern Java,
- to see the use of Java concurrency via the threading model,
- to see the workings of a Java GUI application.

The code you write is relatively small, but the amount you have to read is quite large. We will be running additional webinars to help you with this assignment as we understand that it is complex, but you will learn a great deal from completing the task.
