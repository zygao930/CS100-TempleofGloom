In this assignment, you will help the explorer and Professor of Finance, **Jeremy Hunt**, claim the *Orb of Lots* in the *Temple of Gloom*. You will help him explore an unknown cavern under the temple, claim the orb, and escape before the entrance collapses. There will be great rewards for those who help Jeremy fill his pockets with gold on the way out.

There are two principal phases to this assignment:

- the *exploration phase*, and
- the *escape phase*.

Each of which involves writing a different method in `Java`. We explain these phases in detail after presenting some additional introductory material.
