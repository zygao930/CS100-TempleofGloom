+ The assignment must follow the usual `add/commit` cycle.
+ Your classes, documentation, and unit tests, are all part of your submission.
+ You should include full `javadoc` for your classes (most of which is provided for you anyway).
+ You must include a `README_WHAT_I_DID.md` file detailing the project and any limitations/problems with your submission. It should also include a list of the files/classes you have created/modified.

You are encouraged to have everything ready well in advance to avoid any last-minute problems (e.g., `CODIO` may be down for maintenance).
